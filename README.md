# qq

## Summary
A small note taking CLI script mainly for temporary notes. The notes can be added to a vault if it's valuable to save them for longer. Needed it real quick so it's actually vibe coded with ChatGPT 5. 

## Installation

### MacOS
`sudo ln -s /path/to/qq /usr/local/bin/qq`

### Other
Probably something similar to MacOS. You'll figure it out.

## Usage
```
  qq <note text>         # Add note
  qq p|l                 # Print all notes
  qq pt|lt               # Print all notes prefixed with "TODO:"
  qq p|l <id>            # Print specific note
  qq r <id>              # Remove note
  qq v <id> <title...>   # Vault note to file
```
